### EEG Pattern Synthesis and Recognition - Summary

**Project Title:**  
Visual EEG Pattern Synthesis and Recognition with Deep Learning

**Objective:**  
To classify and generate EEG signal patterns using deep learning models, improving brain-computer interface research.

**Data Used:**  
- `.npy` files for structured EEG data (multi-dimensional NumPy arrays).
- `.dat` files possibly containing raw EEG signals or auxiliary data.

**Steps Performed:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Loaded EEG signals from `.npy` and `.dat` files.
   - Normalized and reshaped data for model compatibility.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Used a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to extract spatial and temporal features from EEG signals.

3. **Data Generation:**
   - Trained a **Conditional GAN (cGAN)** to generate synthetic EEG patterns based on class labels.
   - Generator learned to mimic real EEG signal distributions.

4. **Similarity Check:**
   - Used **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)** to evaluate how close generated signals are to real ones.

**Outcome:**
- The CNN achieved good accuracy on EEG classification.
- The GAN generated visually and structurally similar EEG signals.

**Applications:**
- Brain-computer interfaces (BCI)
- Neurological research
- Synthetic EEG data generation for training models
