### **1. `.npy` (NumPy Array File)**

- A **binary file format** used by NumPy to store arrays efficiently.
- Typically contains multi-dimensional arrays like EEG signal matrices (`channels × time`).
- Stored EEG signals as NumPy arrays.
- Format could be something like:
- filename: `1.npy`

#### Pros:
- Fast loading/saving.
- Preserves array shape and data type.
- Compact and ideal for machine learning workflows.

### **2. `.dat` (Generic Binary Data File)**

- A **general-purpose binary** file extension.
- Its format is **not standardized**—it depends on how the file was written.
- Often used in EEG datasets to store raw signals or metadata.
- Contain raw EEG signals.
- filename: `all_01.dat`
